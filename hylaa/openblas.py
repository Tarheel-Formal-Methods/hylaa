OpenBLAS is a fast parallel library for matrix operations, which is
typically multithreaded for large matrices. This file provides some
functions which let you control certain aspects of OpenBLAS.

has_openblas()     - checks if OpenBLAS was detected on the system
get_num_threads()  - gets the number of threads used by OpenBLAS, or -1
set_num_threads(n) - sets the number of threads if OpenBLAS is installed
OpenBlasThreads(n) - a context object which saves and sets the number of
                     threads OpenBLAS uses. This works even if OpenBLAS
                     is not installed (in which case, it does nothing).


Example code:

print "OpenBLAS detected: {}".format(has_openblas())

with OpenBlasThreads(4):
    print "Number of threads: ", get_num_threads()
